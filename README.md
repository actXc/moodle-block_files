# moodle-block_files

Part of a dashboard for more relevant information at a glance.

Collaboration with [IwoTens](https://github.com/iwotens).

## Description

The block_files module provides a moodle block which shows a configurable number of the most recently uploaded or modified files(mod_resource) and folders(mod_folder) in the course resources of the courses the user is enrolled in with a startdate somewhere within 1-12 months (configurable) from the current date, thereby filtering possibly stale courses. It also provides an option for the user to pin files and folders for later reference.
